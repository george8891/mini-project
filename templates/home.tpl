                                Sample text: Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the
                                seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries,
                                primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The
                                two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but
                                stronger and more hardy robusta.
